  <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
  <p>Hello All!! And Welcome to my journey as an up and coming web deveolper. I am super excited to share my first webpage design showcasing some of the information that i've obtained in such a short amount of time. My goal is to further increase my knowledge in the tech field and gain more understanding of how this field works. I love challenges and being that I am brand new to the tech world, this new endeavor pushes me to new capabilities that I honeslty didn't know were within me. I mean look, I just created a webpage who knows whats in store next. I'm looking forward to see what else I can improve on. </p>
